                    <h1>JFK International Airport UI Redesign</h1>
                    <p>
                        ONGOING: The goal of this project is to restructure the user interface of JFK International Airport's website. Accessibility is the underlying theme with a focus on accommodating the airport's diverse user population. We're paying attention to international travelers who may not be comfortable with English as their preferred language as well as users who may not be as comfortable with navigating technology. Our proposal will facilitate use of the site for a representative user-base appropriate for one of the world's most traveled airports.

                        We are currently in the process of building our web protoype. This semester-long project is through IS 4300: Human Computer Interaction, collaborating with Nick Bond, David Hersey, and Bo-ren Chen.
