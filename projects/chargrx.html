                        I had the opportunity to work with startup ChargRx to draft and create the initial versions of their product design and user experience. ChargRx is a hospitality driven startup focusing on improving patient experience in hospitals with portable charging devices. The challenge at hand was to design the product to be easily understood across the broad range of users present in hospital settings -- overcoming language barriers being one of the top priorities. Constraints also included incorporating space for sponsor branding. This was one of my earliest projects and my first time doing freelance/client work.
