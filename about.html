                    <h2>Design presents me an approach to solving problems, development presents me the tools to get the job done.</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm a second year student at Northeastern University studying computer science and interaction design. I'm passionate about the intersection of art and technology and aim to expand my understanding of effective design. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With a growing background in computer science, my goal is to harness development as a tool for reaching solutions. I stretch across two powerful disciplines, each with the potential to effect change and solve problems. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My interests lie in UI/UX design, human computer interaction, and full-stack development along with typography and data visualization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While most of my experience thus far has been in design, my focus now is on development. I'm eager to learn new skills and take on new challenges as a designer-developer in the making.
